# TIPE-2019

Academic project.

This project is to search a way to escape a close area. That can be apply for any close area of all types. Firstly, I choosed to do simulation with python by created a two-dimensional grid. Secondly, I do simulations with differents patterns and use a genetic algorithm to search a good way to escape. I find way to escape with this method. Thirdly I look the human impact on the way we evacuate an area, like the fact that we use the door we enter to escape and not the closer one.
